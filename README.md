This repository contains a dataset of clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases of the Zika Virus (ZIKV), along with sociodemographic information. The dataset covers the period from 2016 to 2021 and offers valuable insights into the prevalence of ZIKV infections during this time, which can greatly contribute to research and enhance our understanding of the virus's impact on public health.

The data used in this study originate from mandatory notifications recorded in the Notifiable Diseases Information System.

Additionally, we have included the code to apply specific filters to the dataset, allowing users to focus on different aspects of ZIKV cases, such as General ZIKV, ZIKV in Pregnant Women, and ZIKV in Pregnant Women during the 1st trimester.
